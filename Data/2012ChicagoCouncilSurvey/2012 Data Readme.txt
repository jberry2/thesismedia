3. Methodology

The 2012 Chicago Council Survey was conducted May 25–June 8, 2012, among a representative national sample of 1,702 adults. The Council also commissioned a smaller oversample of 175 “Millennials,” those between eighteen and twenty-nine years old, yielding a total sample of 1,877 adults and a margin of sampling error of +/- 2.8 points.

3.1 Sampling Detail

The survey was conducted by GfK Custom Research, a polling, social science, and market research firm in Palo Alto, California. The survey was fielded to a total of 3,135 panel members (2,747 for the general population sample and 388 for the eighteen to twenty-nine-year-old oversample), of which 1,984 completed the survey (1,790 general population, 194 eighteen to twenty-nine-year-old oversample), yielding a completion rate of 63 percent (65% general population, 50% eighteen to twenty-nine-year-old oversample). The survey had a total sample size of 1,877 American adults. Of the total 1,984 completed cases, 107 (88 general population, 19 eighteen to twenty-nine-year-old oversample) were excluded based on four predetermined criteria.

3.2 Conditions for Exclusion

Respondents were excluded if they:

 + Completed the survey in ten minutes or less, of which seventy-four cases were identified.
 + Refused half or more of the items, of which fifty two cases were identified (several respondents overlapped with the item above).
 + Met two of the three following quality checks, of which fifty-two cases were identified:

    (1) Did not accurately answer a question embedded in the survey to make sure respondents were paying attention (“In order to make sure that your browser is working correctly, please select the number four from the list of numbers below.”)

    (2) Refused one or more full batteries containing five or more items (there were fourteen such batteries in the questionnaire)

    (3) Answered exactly the same way to all of the items on at least one of the four lengthy batteries of items.

Of the total 107 excluded respondents, twenty-four failed on all three exclusion criteria, twenty-three failed two of three, and sixty failed one of the three.

3.3 Poststratification Weighting Details

To reduce the effects of any nonresponse and noncoverage bias in panel estimates, a poststratification raking adjustment is applied using demographic distributions from the most recent data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). 

The poststratification variables include age, race, gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and education. This weighting adjustment is applied prior to the selection of any client sample from KnowledgePanel. These weights constitute the starting weights for any client survey selected from the panel. The following benchmark distributions were utilized for this poststratification adjustment:

 + Gender (male/female)
 + Age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+)
 + Race (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, other non-Hispanic, 2+ races non-Hispanic, Hispanic)
 + Education (less than high school, high school, some college, bachelor and beyond)
 + Household income (under $10K, $10K to <$25K, $25K to <$50K, $50K to <$75K, $75K to <$100K, $100K+)
 + Home ownership status (own, rent/other)
 + Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)
 + Metropolitan area (yes, no)
 + Internet access (yes, no)

Comparable distributions are calculated using all valid completed cases from the field data. Since study sample sizes are typically too small to accommodate
a complete cross-tabulation of all the survey variables with the benchmark variables, an iterative proportional fitting is used for the poststratification weighting adjustment. This procedure adjusts the sample data back to the selected benchmark proportions. Through an iterative convergence process, the weighted sample data are optimally fi tted to the marginal distributions. After this final poststratification adjustment, the distribution of the calculated weights is examined to identify and, if necessary, trim outliers at the extreme upper and lower tails of the weight distribution. The poststratified and trimmed weights are then scaled to the sum of the total sample size of all eligible respondents.
